<h2>🙋🏼‍♂️ A Little About Me</h2>

I am currently an IT Support Professional.  I’m a bit nerdy and love all things technology.  In my personal life, I enjoy watching stand-up comedy, playing games with my wife, and shooting hoops at the local parks.  I like to try and stay active, and have been slacklining (kind of like tight rope, but not tight, hence ‘slack’ lol) for a couple years.  I also enjoy video games, and you can usually find me air dribbling in Rocket League in my free time.
